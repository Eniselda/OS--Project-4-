# OS--Project-4-
This project is part of Operating Systems Course. 
In this project, we developed a program that stimulates the following disk scheduling algorithms:
FCFS, SSTF, LOOK and CLOOK (circular look). It gets the input (a sequence of disk requests with their arrival times)
from an input file and prints out the following information for each scheduling algorithm: the total time 
(total head movement in terms of cylinders skipped over) required to serve all requests, the mean request wait time, and the 
standard deviation of the request wait time.
As part of the requirement the arguments required to run this program are : ds <N> <infile.txt>
Here,	<N>	is	the	number	of	cylinders on	the	disk	(1..N).	<infile.txt>	is	the	input	file.
